\item{method}{The method used. \describe{ \item{\code{dictionary}}{Checks
whether the words used in the text are found in a list of English words. It

\code{\link{words_en}}.) Returns the ratio of words found in the list to
the total number of words in the text.}}}

\description{
This function checks the quality of an OCR text. It will return a number
between \code{0} and \code{1}. The higher the number, the better the quality
of the OCR. These measures should not be taken in an absolute sense. That is,
a score of 1 does not indicate perfect OCR. They should only be used to
determine the relative quality of OCR within a corpus of texts. See the
description of methods used to calculate OCR quality below.
