Authors@R: c(person("Lincoln", "Mullen", role = c("aut", "cre"),
    email = "lincoln@lincolnmullen.com"),
    person("Kellen", "Funk", role = "ctb"))
Description: A set of functions for detecting passages which have been reused
    across documents, as well as for calculating similarity between documents
    based on those matches. These functions are intended in the first instance
    for historical research, but should be more broadly applicable.
